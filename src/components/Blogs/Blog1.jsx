          Nitin’s career began in 2008 in a U.S.-based firm, where he spent over
          a decade honing his expertise in data and AI. In 2022, driven by a
          vision to make these transformative technologies more accessible, he

        <p className="sub-text">
          Recognizing the untapped potential of open-source data, Nitin quickly
          pivoted to address a growing demand. Open-source data, often
          overlooked, offers immense opportunities for creating scalable and
          cost-effective AI-driven solutions. His work spans across industries,
          with a particular emphasis on enterprise data and its application in
          real estate AI—revolutionizing property valuation, predictive
          analytics, and market insights by identifying emerging market trends,
          optimizing property investments, and forecasting future demand
          patterns based on regional and economic factors.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, Nitin's efforts have extended to fintech AI, where
          solutions are developed for fraud detection, credit risk assessment,
          and personalized financial planning, and to legal AI, where technology
          is used to streamline contract analysis, case law research, and
          compliance management. These innovations demonstrate how AI-driven
          insights can transform traditional industries by improving efficiency,
          reducing costs, and uncovering new opportunities for growth.
